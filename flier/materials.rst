Python in NeuroImaging
======================


Please provide for every sub-project a brief Description, list of
Features, some nice figure if you have any.  Hopefully eventually we
get enough of tasty materials someone could compose into a flier.

Nitime is a library for time-series analysis of data from neuroscience
experiments.

It contains a core of numerical algorithms for time-series analysis both in
the time and spectral domains, a set of container objects to represent
time-series, and auxiliary objects that expose a high level interface to the
numerical machinery and make common analysis tasks easy to express with
compact and semantically clear code.

PyMVPA

PyMVPA eases statistical learning analyses (or otherwise called
Multivariate pattern analysis, MVPA) of large datasets, with an accent
on neuroimaging.

Features:

 - Easy I/O to Neuroimaging data (via NiBabel)
 - Variety of machine learning methods (e.g. SVM, SMLR, kNN)
 - Uniform interfaces to other toolkits (e.g. MDP, Shogun, Scikit-learn)
 - Flexible Searchlight-ing
 - Uber-Fast GNB Searchlight-ing
 - Hyperalignment (Haxby et al 2011, Neuron)
