Python in NeuroImaging
======================

Please provide for every sub-project a brief Description, list of
Features, some nice figure if you have any.  Hopefully eventually we
get enough of tasty materials someone could compose into a flier.

   :figwidth: 35%

Nibabel provides read and write access to some common medical and neuroimaging
file formats, including: ANALYZE_ (plain, SPM99, SPM2), GIFTI_, NIfTI1_, MINC_,
as well as PAR/REC. NiBabel is the successor of PyNIfTI_.

.. _ANALYZE: http://www.grahamwideman.com/gw/brain/analyze/formatdoc.htm
.. _NIfTI1: http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/
.. _MINC: http://wiki.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/index.php/MINC
.. _PyNIfTI: http://niftilib.sourceforge.net/pynifti/
.. _GIFTI: http://www.nitrc.org/projects/gifti

The various image format classes give full or selective access to header (meta)
information and access to the image data is made available via NumPy arrays.

Analysis
--------

NiPy
~~~~
http://nipy.org/nipy

NIPY has algorithms for the analysis of neuroimaging data including:

* General linear model statistical analysis
* Combined slice time correction and motion correction
* General image registration routines with flexible cost functions, optimizers
  and resampling schemes
* Image segmentation
* Basic visualization of results in 2D and 3D
* Basic time series diagnostics
* Clustering and activation pattern analysis across subjects

Nipype
~~~~~~
http://nipy.org/nipype

 Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of 
algorithms from different packages (e.g., SPM, FSL, FreeSurfer, Camino, AFNI, 
Slicer), eases the design of workflows within and between packages, and 
reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype is 
creating a collaborative platform for neuroimaging software development in a 
high-level language and addressing limitations of existing pipeline systems.

Nipype allows you to:

 - easily interact with tools from different software packages
 - combine processing steps from different software packages
 - develop new workflows faster by reusing common steps from old ones
 - process data faster by running it in parallel on many cores/machines
 - make your research easily reproducible
 - share your processing workflows with the community

http://nipy.org/dipy

.. figure:: ../pics/dipy-banner.png
   :alt: nibabel
   :align: right
   :figwidth: 35%

Dipy is an international, free and open soure software project for
diffusion magnetic resonance imaging analysis.

Dipy is multiplatform and will run under any standard operating system such as
*Windows*, *Linux*, *Mac OS X*.

Just some of our **state-of-the-art** applications are:

- Reconstruction algorithms e.g. GQI, DTI
- Tractography generation algorithms e.g. EuDX
- Intelligent downsampling of tracks
- Ultra fast tractography clustering
- Resampling datasets with anisotropic voxels to isotropic
- Visualizing multiple brains simultaneously
- Finding track correspondence between different brains
- Warping tractographies into another space e.g. MNI space
- Reading many different file formats e.g. Trackvis or Nifti
- Dealing with huge tractographies without memory restrictions
- Playing with datasets interactively without storing
- And much more and even more to come in next releases


NiTime
~~~~~~
http://nipy.org/nitime

.. figure:: ../pics/nitime_logo.pdf
   :alt: nitime
   :align: right
   :figwidth: 35%

Nitime is a library for time-series analysis of data from neuroscience
experiments.

It contains a core of numerical algorithms for time-series analysis both in
the time and spectral domains, a set of container objects to represent
time-series, and auxiliary objects that expose a high level interface to the
numerical machinery and make common analysis tasks easy to express with
compact and semantically clear code.

Features:
 - Spectral transforms (including multi-tapered spectral analysis) and
   filtering. 
 - Connectivity measures (Correlation, Coherency, Granger 'causality').
 - Event-related analysis (including OLS finitie impulse response).

.. figure:: ../pics/pymvpa_logo.pdf
   :alt: PyMVPA
   :align: right
   :figwidth: 35%

PyMVPA eases statistical learning analyses (or otherwise called
Multivariate pattern analysis, MVPA) of large datasets, with an accent
on neuroimaging.

Features:

 - Easy I/O to Neuroimaging data (via NiBabel)
 - Variety of machine learning methods (e.g. SVM, SMLR, kNN)
 - Uniform interfaces to other toolkits (e.g. MDP, Shogun, Scikit-learn)
 - Flexible Searchlight-ing
 - Uber-Fast GNB Searchlight-ing
 - Hyperalignment (Haxby et al 2011, Neuron)
