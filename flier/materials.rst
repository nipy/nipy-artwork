Python in NeuroImaging
======================


Please provide for every sub-project a brief Description, list of
Features, some nice figure if you have any.  Hopefully eventually we
get enough of tasty materials someone could compose into a flier.

Nitime is a library for time-series analysis of data from neuroscience
experiments.

It contains a core of numerical algorithms for time-series analysis both in
the time and spectral domains, a set of container objects to represent
time-series, and auxiliary objects that expose a high level interface to the
numerical machinery and make common analysis tasks easy to express with
compact and semantically clear code.

Features:
 - Spectral transforms (including multi-tapered spectral analysis) and
   filtering. 
 - Connectivity measures (Correlation, Coherency, Granger 'causality').
 - Event-related analysis (including OLS finitie impulse response).

PyMVPA eases statistical learning analyses (or otherwise called
Multivariate pattern analysis, MVPA) of large datasets, with an accent
on neuroimaging.

Features:

 - Easy I/O to Neuroimaging data (via NiBabel)
 - Variety of machine learning methods (e.g. SVM, SMLR, kNN)
 - Uniform interfaces to other toolkits (e.g. MDP, Shogun, Scikit-learn)
 - Flexible Searchlight-ing
 - Uber-Fast GNB Searchlight-ing
 - Hyperalignment (Haxby et al 2011, Neuron)
