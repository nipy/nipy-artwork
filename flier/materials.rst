Python in NeuroImaging
======================


Please provide for every sub-project a brief Description, list of
Features, some nice figure if you have any.  Hopefully eventually we
get enough of tasty materials someone could compose into a flier.

PsychoPy is an easy, precise, platform-independent package for stimulus presentation. Suitable for psychophysics, neuroimaging, and all areas of psychology.

Features:

    - Huge variety of stimuli generated in real-time
    - Platform independent - run the same script on Win, OS X or Linux
    - Flexible stimulus units (degrees, cm, or pixels)
    - Coder interface for those that like to program
    - Builder interface for those that donâ€™t
    - Input from keyboard, mouse, joystick or button boxes
    - Multi-monitor support
    - Automated monitor calibration (for supported photometers)

Nipype
~~~~~~
http://nipy.org/nipype

 Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of 
algorithms from different packages (e.g., SPM, FSL, FreeSurfer, Camino, AFNI, 
Slicer), eases the design of workflows within and between packages, and 
reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype is 
creating a collaborative platform for neuroimaging software development in a 
high-level language and addressing limitations of existing pipeline systems.

Nipype allows you to:

 - easily interact with tools from different software packages
 - combine processing steps from different software packages
 - develop new workflows faster by reusing common steps from old ones
 - process data faster by running it in parallel on many cores/machines
 - make your research easily reproducible
 - share your processing workflows with the community

NiTime

   :figwidth: 35%

Nitime is a library for time-series analysis of data from neuroscience
experiments.

It contains a core of numerical algorithms for time-series analysis both in
the time and spectral domains, a set of container objects to represent
time-series, and auxiliary objects that expose a high level interface to the
numerical machinery and make common analysis tasks easy to express with
compact and semantically clear code.

Features:
 - Spectral transforms (including multi-tapered spectral analysis) and
   filtering. 
 - Connectivity measures (Correlation, Coherency, Granger 'causality').
 - Event-related analysis (including OLS finitie impulse response).

   :alt: PyMVPA
   :align: right
   :figwidth: 35%

PyMVPA eases statistical learning analyses (or otherwise called
Multivariate pattern analysis, MVPA) of large datasets, with an accent
on neuroimaging.

Features:

 - Easy I/O to Neuroimaging data (via NiBabel)
 - Variety of machine learning methods (e.g. SVM, SMLR, kNN)
 - Uniform interfaces to other toolkits (e.g. MDP, Shogun, Scikit-learn)
 - Flexible Searchlight-ing
 - Uber-Fast GNB Searchlight-ing
 - Hyperalignment (Haxby et al 2011, Neuron)
